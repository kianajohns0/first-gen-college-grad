# Impact of First-Generation Status on Graduation Rates

## Overview
This project investigates the impact of being a first-generation college student on graduation rates. By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning models, we aim to understand the challenges faced by first-generation students and identify factors that influence their academic success.

## Project Description
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to students' academic performance, demographic information, and support systems. Our objective is to pinpoint key factors affecting graduation rates among first-generation students and provide actionable insights.

Key aspects of this project include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
- **Model Building:** Applying statistical and machine learning models to assess the impact of first-generation status on graduation rates.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance and deriving insights for improving student success.
